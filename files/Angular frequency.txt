[[Image:AngularFrequency.gif|thumb|Angular frequency [[omega|''ω'']] (in radians per second), is larger than frequency ''ν'' (in cycles per second, also called [[Hertz|Hz]]), by a factor of 2''π''. This figure uses the symbol ''ν'', rather than ''f'' to denote frequency.]]

In [[physics]], '''angular frequency''' ''ω'' (also referred to by the terms '''angular speed''', '''radial frequency''', '''circular frequency''', '''orbital frequency''', '''radian frequency''', and '''pulsatance''') is a scalar measure of rotation rate. It refers to the [[angular displacement]] per unit time (e.g., in rotation) or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform (e.g., in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function.

Angular frequency (or angular speed) is the magnitude of the vector quantity ''[[angular velocity]]''. The term '''angular frequency vector''' <math>\vec{\omega}</math> is sometimes used as a synonym for the vector quantity angular velocity.<ref name="UP1">{{cite book

where:
:''ω'' is the angular frequency or angular speed (measured in [[radians per second]]),
:''T'' is the [[Frequency|period]] (measured in [[second]]s),
:''f'' is the [[ordinary frequency]] (measured in [[hertz]]) (sometimes symbolised with [[nu (letter)|''ν'']]).

==Units==
In [[SI]] [[Units of measurement|units]], angular frequency is normally presented in [[radian]]s per [[second]], even when it does not express a rotational value. From the perspective of [[dimensional analysis]], the unit [[hertz]] (Hz) is also correct, but in practice it is only used for ordinary frequency ''f'', and almost never for ''ω''. This convention helps avoid confusion.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJhkD0LKtJEC&pg=PA145| title= Physics for scientists and engineers| first=Lawrence S.|last= Lerner|page=145| isbn=978-0-86720-479-7| date=1996-01-01}}</ref>

In [[digital signal processing]], the angular frequency may be normalized by the [[sampling rate]], yielding the [[normalized frequency (digital signal processing)|normalized frequency]].

==Circular motion==
{{main|Circular motion}}
In a rotating or orbiting object, there is a relation between distance from the axis, [[tangential speed]], and the angular frequency of the rotation:
:<math>\omega = v/r.</math>

===Oscillations of a spring===

An object attached to a spring can [[Oscillation|oscillate]]. If the spring is assumed to be ideal and massless with no damping, then the motion is [[Harmonic oscillator|simple and harmonic]] with an angular frequency given by<ref name=PoP1>{{cite book

:<math> \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, </math>

where
:''k'' is the [[spring constant]],
:''m'' is the mass of the object.

ω is referred to as the natural frequency (which can sometimes be denoted as ω<sub>0</sub>).

As the object oscillates, its acceleration can be calculated by
:<math>a = -\omega^2 x, </math>
where ''x'' is displacement from an equilibrium position.

Using "ordinary" revolutions-per-second frequency, this equation would be
:<math> a = -4 \pi^2 f^2 x. </math>

===LC circuits===
The resonant angular frequency in a series [[LC circuit]] equals the square root of the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the product of the [[capacitance]] (''C'' measured in [[farad]]s) and the [[inductance]] of the circuit (''L'', with SI unit [[Henry (unit)|henry]]):<ref name=LC1>{{cite book

:<math>\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}.</math> 

Adding series resistance (for example, due to the resistance of the wire in a coil) does not change the resonant frequency of the series LC circuit. For a parallel tuned circuit, the above equation is often a useful approximation, but the resonant frequency does depend on the losses of parallel elements.
